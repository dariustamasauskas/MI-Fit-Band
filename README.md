## Project on MI Fit Band data

The project aim is to analyze the data generated by using MI Fit Band 3 and compare it to Huawei Health data.

The data from MI Fit Band was extracted from the app and contains the records from the period of **2019 04 12 - 2019 06 16**. The files were extracted as separate .csv files and I decided to use the following ones for the analysis:
- ACTIVITY.csv
- SLEEP.csv

The data from Huawei Health app was inputted manually into the .xlsx file (as there is no option for extracting it) and contains the records for the same period as MI Fit Band. The data is the following file:
- HUAWEI.xlsx
